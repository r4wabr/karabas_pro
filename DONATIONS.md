### FDImage tool by Doctor Max

Thanks to all bakers, with your help it was possible to release a nice new tool - **FDImage by Doctor Max!**

With this tool you're able to extract FDD images (FDI, PRO, TRD, SCL, TD0) to real floppy disks.

Feel free to send any amount of USD/EUR/etc to support **Doctor Max** - a developer of this nice tool:
